<p style="color: red;"><img src="https://d27k8xmh3cuzik.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Swayambhunath-in-Kathmandu-Valley-Swayambhunath-temple-is-among-the-best-Nepal-places-to-visit-near-Kathmandu-valley.jpg" alt="swayambhunath" height="200" width="200">an ancient religious architecture atop a hill in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu_Valley">Kathmandu Valley</a>, west of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu_Valley"> Kathmandu city</a>. The Tibetan name for the site means 'Sublime Trees' (Wylie: Phags.pa Shing.kun), for the many varieties of trees found on the hill. However, Shing.kun may be a corruption of the local Nepal Bhasa name for the complex, Singgu, meaning 'self-sprung'. For the Buddhist Newars, in whose mythological history and origin myth as well as day-to-day religious practice Swayambhunath occupies a central position, it is probably the most sacred among Buddhist pilgrimage sites. For Tibetans and followers of Tibetan Buddhism, it is second only to Boudha.
<b>Swyambhunath Swyambhunath of a stupa, a variety of shrines and temples, some dating back to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=Licchavi+period&title=Special%3ASearch&go=Go">Licchavi period</a>. A Tibetan monastery, museum and library are more recent additions. The stupa has Buddha's eyes and eyebrows painted on. Between them, the number one (in Devanagari script) is painted in the fashion of a nose. There are also shops, restaurants and hostels. The site has two access points: a long staircase leading directly to the main platform of the temple, which is from the top of the hill to the east; and a car road around the hill from the south leading to the south-west entrance. The first sight on reaching the top of the stairway is the Vajra. Tsultrim Allione describes the experience.</b>
We were breathless and sweating as we stumbled up the last steep steps and practically fell upon the biggest vajra (thunderbolt scepter) that I have ever seen. Behind this Vajra was the vast, round, white dome of the stupa, like a full solid skirt, at the top of which were two giant Buddha eyes wisely looking out over the peaceful valley which was just beginning to come alive.[2]
Much of Swayambhunath's iconography comes from the Vajrayana tradition of Newar Buddhism. However, the complex is also an important site for Buddhists of many schools, and is also revered by Hindus.

<p style="color:yellow;"><i>a famous and sacred Hindu temple complex that is located on the banks of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagmati_River">Bagmati River</a>, approximately 5 kilometres north-east of Kathmandu in the eastern part of Kathmandu Valley,[1] the capital of Nepal. The temple serves as the seat of Nepal's national deity, Lord Pashupatinath. This temple complex was inscribed on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO">UNESCO</a> World Heritage Sites's list in 1979.[2][3] This "extensive Hindu temple precinct" is a "sprawling collection of temples, ashrams, images and inscriptions raised over the centuries along the banks of the sacred Bagmati river" and is included as one of the seven monument groups in UNESCO's designation of Kathmandu Valley as a cultural heritage site.[4] One of the major Festivals of the temple is Maha Shivaratri on which day over 1 million devotees visit here.[5]

The temple is one of the 275 Tamil Paadal Petra Sthalams (Holy Abodes of Shiva) on the continent. Kotirudra Samhita, Chapter 11 on the Shivalingas of the North, in Shiva Purana mentions this Shivalinga as the bestower of all wishes.</i>

<p style="color:blue;"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Boudhanath_Panorama_2016.jpg/1920px-Boudhanath_Panorama_2016.jpg" alt="Bouddhanath" height="200" width="200">a stupa in Kathmandu, Nepal.[2] Located about 11 km (6.8 mi) from the center and northeastern outskirts of Kathmandu, the stupa's massive mandala makes it one of the largest spherical stupas in Nepal.[3]

The Buddhist stupa of Boudha Stupa dominates the skyline; it is one of the largest unique structure's stupas in the world. The influx of large populations of refugees from Tibet has seen the construction of over 50 gompas (Tibetan convent) around Boudha. As of 1979, Boudha Stupa is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Along with Swayambhu, it is one of the most popular tourist sites in the Kathmandu area.

The Stupa is on the ancient trade route from Tibet which enters the Kathmandu Valley by the village of Sankhu in the northeast corner, passes by Boudha Stupa to the ancient and smaller stupa of Chā-bahī named Charumati Stupa (often called "Little Boudhanath"). It then turns directly south, heading over the Bagmati River to Lalitpur - thus bypassing the main city of Kathmandu (which was a later foundation).[2] Tibetan merchants have rested and offered prayers here for many centuries. When refugees entered Nepal from Tibet in the 1950s, many decided to live around Boudhanath. The Stupa is said to entomb the remains of Kassapa Buddha.
