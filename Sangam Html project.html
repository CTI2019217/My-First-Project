<h1> Sangam's First Try </h1>
<p> In this sample, I am going to tell you few things you need to visit in Nepal. There are lot of things and places in Nepal that attract the people from different countries.</p> 
<p> The first one is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Everest"> Mount Everest </a>. You know about Mt. Everest, Right?? It is the world's highest mountain which is 8,848m high. Here is the image of <b>Mt. Everest.</b></p>

<p> Another one is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbini"> LUMBINI </a>,the birthplace of lord <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha"> BUDDHA </a>. His real name is Sidhdhartha Gautam. He is also known as <b>The light of the Asia.</b> </p>

<p> The third one is <i>the bravery of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurkha"> THE GURKHAS </a> </i>, one of the Bravest and talented amry force in the world. They are also known as "Gorkhali". They have given a huge contribution to UN peacekeeping force, British army, Nepalese army, Indian army, Gurkha Contingent Singapore and Gurkha Reserve Unit Brunei.</p>

<p>Well, this is not the end of the list but I got no time to explain all the things of Nepal. I had to make a sample,I did it. I hope it is enough for my first try. All I wanna say is this is my begining, I'm gonna make some complicated webpage someday in future. </p>
<p>Opps, I mistakenly pushed my friend's project to mine. I am changing this(which is mine) to replace it with his project. </p>
